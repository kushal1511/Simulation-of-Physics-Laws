# Simulation-of-Physics-Laws
The project uses GLUT Library to simulate Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, showing how electricity can be produced by manipulating magnetic fields. By observing the light bulb turning on or varying in brightness as the magnetic field changes, the project visually represents the concept. Faraday's law is a fundamental principle underlying power generation in generators and the operation of various electrical devices. The project effectively showcases the direct relationship between changing magnetic fields and the generation of electricity, offering a tangible example of the concept in action
